# Contributing

Thanks for getting involved, we really appreciate the help!

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/undind/react-gcolor-picker/issues); it's that easy!

## Repository Structure

This repository contains 3 folders:

- /src contains all the React components
- /example is our [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) based demo website
- /stories is our [storybook](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) demo

## Setup and Run

To setup and run a local copy:

1.  Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/undind/react-gcolor-picker`
2.  Run `npm install` in the root folder
3.  Run `npm install` in the example folder
4.  In seperate terminal windows, run `npm start` in the root and example folders.

You should now be up and running with live browser reloading of the example website while you work on React components in the /src folder.

## Testing and lint

We have a unit test suite written with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

```sh
npm test
npm run test:watch
```

You can use all of the Jest API and Enzyme API.
